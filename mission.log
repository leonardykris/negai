## Long version:

I have listened to anime songs since time immemorial. Or at least since doraemon and shin-chan or chibi maruko-chan.

But the time I started really trying to memorize them was middle school I think.
BoA every hearts, for example.
Or Naruto's.

And like the beginner I was, all I read are the romaji, because it's the only format I can read.

There was this time I really thought I want to go to Japan, os I took japanese lessons in high school and attempted N5, but our school exam was unforgiving (so that you have to really cram for it) and I missed my N5 by just a few points. Then somewhere around this time I read that the # of cases of death by overworking is really high in Japan and it really turned me off.

But I kept listening to anime songs and game OSTs.

University gave me a lot of time. So I watched more. But it was not until I finished university and did so many things that I finally thought to myself I want to learn it seriously. More like, because I started to meet more Japanese in my work or environment that I wish to be able to have an easier conversation with them. Plus, my brother is living there now for university and reached N1. It's like, I have this thought that if he can do it (and be fluent in it), then I can too.

But basically, when I read those lyrics most of the time they separate the kanji/romaji/english interface.

There are some other formats, wait, I think I wrote all of this somewhere before. Maybe in my notes.
