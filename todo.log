Next stuff I want to do are:
1. Count the amount of unique kanjis
2. Divide them to their difficulty level (N1-N5)
3. Store an array of them in the song database
4. Do analysis of which kanji is the most common out of a number of songs.

Because basically, If a single kanji exists in 10 songs, you better learn that shit. Because it's more cost efficient. While if this single kanji only appears 1 out of 100 you better don't put too much time to it.

- Hiragana/Katakana chart that is searchable
  - When you click on one of them then the entire lyrics result lit up, as in, the character that has it.
    - So like if you click on か, then all the か instances in the lyrics show up in one color.
    - Should it be background or text color though?
